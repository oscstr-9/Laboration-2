During this lab i learnt a lot about vectors, case/switch and array handling, espesially 2d arrays.
The most difficult part about this lab was definitely task 3, which I solved through a lot of 
googling aswell as trial and error. The critisism I can give for this lab is that the instructions were 
very much up to interpretation and not very obvious at times. The hardest task to fully understand how to do was
task 7 and I'm still not sure if i did it the intended way. i probably spent around 28 hours or so on this lab in total.
